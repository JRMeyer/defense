# Josh Meyer's Dissertation Defense Slides

These are the slides from my dissertation defense, as a PDF (`defense.pdf`) and a libreoffice slideshow (`defense.odp`).

There are other `odp` slides that I have used to present my research (`lit-review.odp`) or give Text-to-speech (`tts-vishka.odp`) or Speech-to-text (`stt-vishka.odp`) tutorials
